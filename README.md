# tfelix21.github.io

1. Tiandra Felix tfelix@my.waketech.edu
2. I created a GitHub account with the username tfelix21.
3. I created a repository by adding my username for GitHub and making it public.
4. How I cloned the repository is I created an account with GitHub desktop and it connected to my account I just created with GitHub and I selected to clone the repository that I previously created. 
I was able to connect both accounts together. I am adding few more changes.
